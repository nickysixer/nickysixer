### Hi, my name is Nick ðŸ‘‹

I am an award-winning Web Developer & Designer living in Cleveland, Ohio. I have over 15 years of web development and design experience, most of which have been focused on custom Wordpress theme and plugin development. Simply, I live and breathe all front-end technologies and well-crafted code; they are my tools to build budget-conscious websites and top-of-the-line business tools.

Not only can I execute projects as a developer, but I am also an accomplished graphic and web designer. With my unique skill set, I seamlessly bridge the gap between design and development, creating high-quality projects from start to finish.
