### Hi, my name is Nick Goers ðŸ‘‹

- Current Position: VP of Technology & Development Manager @ [Company 119](https://www.company119.com)

### About Me

I am an award-winning Web Developer & Designer living in Cleveland, Ohio. 

I have almost 20 years of web development and design experience, most of which have been focused on custom [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) theme and plugin development, but more recently, I've been building a lot with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). I live and breathe all web technologies and well-crafted code; they are my tools to create budget-conscious, highly functional websites and top-of-the-line business tools.

Not only can I execute projects as a developer, but I am also an accomplished graphic and web designer. With my unique skill set, I seamlessly bridge the gap between design and development, creating high-quality projects from start to finish.
